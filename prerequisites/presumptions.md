# Presumptions

Cloudbox presumes you have a basic understanding of Linux, Docker containers, BitTorrent, and Usenet, and are also familiar with Sonarr, Radarr, NZBGet, rTorrent/ruTorrent, and Plex/Emby.

The guides in this wiki are only meant to setup Cloudbox specific settings into the various apps that are installed with Cloudbox \(e.g. Sonarr, Radarr, Plex, etc\) and are not meant to be a full setup for, or an introduction to, the workings of these apps. However, you may pickup a few things as you go thru the guides.

If you wish to learn more about them in detail, you can easily find a ton of guides for them online \(e.g. [HTPC Guides](https://www.htpcguides.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), etc\).
